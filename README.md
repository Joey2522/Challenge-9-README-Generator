# Challenge-9-README-Generator

  ## Repo Name
  Joey2522/Challenge-9-README-Generator
  
  ## Description
  This application will guide you through creating a professional and thorough README for your own personal projects. Using node.js in your computers command line you will be prompted to answer a set of typical README questions. Once you have completed the questions a README will be generated. Using a GitHub api your github repo, photo and contact information will be populated into your README as well. 

  ## Installation
  I had to install node.js “inquirer” in order to create this README generator.

  ## Motivation
  I wanted to help my fellow coders with a quick and easy way to generate a professional README.

  ## What Problem Does This Project Solve
  It can be difficult and time consuming to create a README file from scratch. I wanted to help alleviate this problem with this project.

  ## What I Learned
  I learned how to use node.js in the command line to run index.js and use JavaScript right on my desktop and without the need for a browser.

  ## Instructions
  Using your command line in the terminal navigate to the file containing the README Generator file. Once there you can run “node index.js” and the program will begin to ask you questions. Once you have answered all of the questions your README.md file will be generated in the same fold you are currently operating out of.

  ## Contributors
  To begin this project, I was given some starter code from the UT Bootcamp. I also found a method for the GitHub api from a former bootcamp student, @connietran-dev.
